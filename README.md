# Workit Health Front-End Assessment

Hello! Thanks for considering Workit Health in your job search. We'd like to get familiar with how you code prior to your technical interview, so we'll be asking you to build a snippet of our EMR. We expect this to take about an hour; please don't spend more than 2 hours on this â€“ we will happily accept incomplete projects, as long as we have a chance to see your code.

## The Details

To start: please **clone** this repository to make any changes. Please also make your repository private so that others who are interviewing cannot search for your code.

We would like to build a clinic overview page to view a list of our clinics. In the root repository, `clinic_dashboard.png` is the design that has been provided for you.

### Development notes

- For the purposes of this assessment, you do not have to build the Nationwide tile
- Ignore the "+" button to the top of the Clinic Dashboard
- The information in the clinic tiles are links, but you can set them as `href="#"`
- Clinic data has been provided as an array of objects, and can be found in `src/clinicData.js`

### Design details

Some aspects of the design have been pre-defined; anything not listed below is up to you.

- Padding between the tiles is 32px
- Padding inside the tiles is 32px
- You can use `Poppins` as the font family; it will not match the design exactly, but is fine for the assessment
- The links to the images are below
